# Research

This directory holds the parts of Chakaso that are questions rather than
specifications.

| Document | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [`research-log.md`](research-log.md) | Dated entries: observations, decisions, and eventually experiments and results |
| [`literature.md`](literature.md) | Sources that informed the initial design, and what each one supports |
| [`hypotheses.md`](hypotheses.md) | Statements the project intends to test, with what would falsify them |
| [`open-questions.md`](open-questions.md) | Questions with no committed answer |

## How entries are written

A research note distinguishes these, and does not blur them:

- **Observation** — something seen, from a run, a reading, or the repository.
- **Hypothesis** — a claim that could be false.
- **Experiment** — a procedure that could distinguish between hypotheses.
- **Result** — what the procedure produced.
- **Interpretation** — what the result is taken to mean.
- **Limitation** — what the result does not establish.
- **Conclusion** — what is now believed, and at what strength.

The reason for the ceremony is that a research log which mixes a hunch with a
measurement is worse than no log, because the hunch acquires the authority of the
measurement over time.

## Standard of evidence

- No result is recorded without the configuration, versions and seed that produced
  it.
- No comparison is recorded without a baseline on the same version.
- No claim of improvement is recorded without the numbers.
- A negative result is a result and is recorded as one.
- If something was not measured, the log says it was not measured.

## Current state

**No experiment has been run.** There is no model, no tokenizer, no dataset and no
retrieval implementation, so there is nothing to measure. Everything in this
directory today is design reasoning and open questions, and it is labelled as
such.
